# Rotifer Dataset Samples

`frame.png` is a sampled frame from the microscopic video of the rotifer sample.

Rotifers, ciliates, and other moving particles were cropped from the video frame and annotated.
- `/data` contains a small batch of the cropped objects.
- `samples.csv` are the annotations for the small batch data.
- `frame_annotated.png` shows the visualization of the annotations.
- Labels: 
-- NECR: non-egg carrying rotifers.
-- ECR: egg carrying rotifers.
-- MR: mutiple rotifers. 
-- SP: small moving particles (ciliates/detritus). 

As of today, the full dataset contains 52,868 annotated data. The full dataset will be released in mid 2021.
